# Sensor Network

### Broadcast Chatting Project using Contiki OS

In this project, we use the 6LowPan technologies and work with
the Contiki Operating System.
Through the labs and our personal work, we were able to get more and more
familiar with COOJA Wireless Sensor Network simulator.
We also build a complete tool chain for developing and deploying a Contiki
OS application on native and microcontroller platform.
For this project we had to write Patch, Makefile and scripts using
Linux tools.

### About Contiki OS

Contiki is an open source operating system for networked, memory-constrained systems with a particular focus on low-power wireless Internet of Things devices. Examples of where Contiki is used include street lighting systems, sound monitoring for smart cities, radiation monitoring systems, and alarm systems. Contiki was created by Adam Dunkels in 2002 and has been further developed by a world-wide team of developers from Atmel, Cisco, ENEA, ETH Zurich, Redwire, RWTH Aachen University, Oxford University, SAP, Sensinode, Swedish Institute of Computer Science, ST Microelectronics, Zolertia, and many others.

Despite providing multitasking and a built-in TCP/IP stack, Contiki only needs about 10 kilobytes of RAM and 30 kilobytes of ROM. A full system, complete with a graphical user interface, needs about 30 kilobytes of RAM which makes Contiki OS the most popular OS for the Internet of Things.
