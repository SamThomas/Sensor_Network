# Sensor Network

### Broadcast Chatting Project using Contiki OS

In this project, we use the 6LowPan technologies and work with
the Contiki Operating System.
Through the labs and our personal work, we were able to get more and more
familiar with COOJA Wireless Sensor Network simulator.
We also build a complete tool chain for developing and deploying a Contiki
OS application on native and microcontroller platform.
For this project we obviously had to write Patch, Makefile and scripts using
Linux tools.
